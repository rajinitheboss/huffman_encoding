# huffman_encoding
This code encodes the given string into binary sequence using huffman technique.
When you give a string at input string.txt file and after running the huffmanencoding.cpp,
you will get a encoded string in encoded.txt file and if you want to decode an encoded string you should run the huffmandecode.cpp 
the decoded string will be in decodestring.txt
